# Game Recommendation NLP Solution

Welcome to the Game Recommendation NLP Solution repository! Here, you'll find the complete code for a natural language processing (NLP) solution designed to address unstructured data challenges in game recommendation. Leveraging comments from a blog, we've crafted a recommendation system that helps users discover new games based on their interests and preferences.

## Introduction

In today's digital age, discovering new games can be overwhelming due to the sheer volume of available titles. Our NLP solution aims to simplify this process by analyzing user comments from a blog and extracting valuable insights to provide personalized game recommendations.

## Solution Overview

The solution follows a structured approach to tackle the game recommendation problem:

1. **Data Scraping**: We scrape comments from a blog to gather raw user feedback and opinions on various games.
2. **Data Cleaning**: The collected data undergoes thorough cleaning to remove noise, irrelevant information, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We conduct exploratory analysis to gain insights into user sentiments, popular game genres, and common themes in the comments.
4. **Word Combination Analysis**: By analyzing word combinations and phrases, we extract meaningful patterns and preferences expressed by users.
5. **Recommendation Based on Attributes**: We develop a recommendation system that suggests games based on specific attributes such as genre, platform, or gameplay features.
6. **Recommendation Based on Similarities**: Leveraging NLP techniques, we identify similarities between user preferences and recommend games that align closely with their interests.
